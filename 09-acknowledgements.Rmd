This thesis was primarily realized at Lillehammer University College/Inland University of Applied Sciences and Sykehuset innlandet. Without the help of  

Stian Ellefsen, my main supervisor during these years, I would not have been the same scientist without your enthusiasm. You have thought me that science is fun, and serious, bust mostly fun, but also serious business.  

Bent R. Rønnestad, my co-supervisor

Eva Blomstrand, my co-supervisor at GIH, thank you for taking me on board and for all your support. 

I am grateful for the support from The Swedish School of Sport and Health
Sciences, GIH, especially Kent Sahlin who created a spot for me in your doctorate program and Camilla Norrbin and Bim O’Reilly for keeping track on me during these years. I regret not spending more time at GIH during these years, I always felt at home Lidingövägen 1.

William Apro thaught everything I know about western blotting! Thank you for being a great mentor and meeting me at the Åstrand laboratory at 5:45 in the morning. 




While working with this thesis I have been fortunate to teach at our bachelor- and master-program in sport science. I would like to thank all devoted students trying to learn Swedish while I was talking about cross-country skiing, strength testing or data science. You have undoubtedly thought me more than I have managed to accomplish in the opposite direction.



Jostein Flata, Bente Malerbakken

During my years at Lillehammer university college (later Inland University of Applied Sciences)^[I do not know who came up with this name, the abbreviation does not read well in English] we planned three different labs and built one. 


Thanks to all my old colleagues at Dalarna University (Anders, Tomas, Magnus, Frej, Michail, ), I hope you have not forgotten about me! Thanks to Emma Hawke for advice on life in general, science and the English language in particular. 


Thanks to my Norwegian family, Torill, Eivind, Stina, Petter, Emil, Anton, Oskar, Ida, Bent, Elvira, Olava and Ingrid for supporting me and Marie during these years.

Marie, I'm sorry for all the late nights, early mornings and weekends i did not spend with you. You have supported me during this time, and we are still together, success! I love you!
