# Conclusions

The main conclusions drawn from the work presented in this thesis are


\begin{itemize}
  \item muscle mass and strength are differentially affected by resistance training volume, expressed as the within-sessions number of sets, in a dose-dependent manner.
  \item Moderate compared to low-volume training leads to greater ribosomal biogenesis and mRNA expression related to extracellular matrix remodeling.
  \item Moderate compared to low-volume exercise leads to a higher activity of
mTORC1-related signaling.
  \item Resistance training-induced shifts in fiber type distributions are sensitive to training volume as moderate compared to low training volumes leads to a greater reduction in Type IIX proportions over twelve weeks of training but less reduction in response to four sessions.
  \item The ability to differentiate total RNA accumulation in response to different training volumes after four training sessions predicts benefits of moderate compared to low-volume training after twelve weeks.
  \item Maximal accumulation of total RNA in response to resistance training occurs after eight sessions in previously untrained young individuals.
  \item Accumulation of total and ribosomal RNA is not affected by variable training volume. However, eight days of de-training training reduced the synthesis of ribosomal precursor RNA and total RNA content.
  \item Total RNA abundance is positively related to upstream binding factor protein-expression.
\end{itemize}
