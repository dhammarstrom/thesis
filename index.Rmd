<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete lines 27 and 28 above or add a # before them to comment them out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

```{r include_packages, include = FALSE}
# This chunk ensures that the thesisdown package is
# installed and loaded. This thesisdown package includes
# the template files for the thesis.

```{r create_package_bib, include = FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c("base", "qpcR"), "./bib/packages.bib") ### This creates a bibfile for R packages

# Introduction

<!-- Why study muscle functioning and health? -->

[@RN2184] <!-- Excess health care costs associated with muscle weakness was estimated to 1.3 billion punds in UK in population above 70 yrs   --> 


<!-- Muscle mass and strength, multiple components contribute to muscle health -->



<!-- Pharmacological/nutritional/exercise interventions to maintain muscle mass --->

<!-- Problem with prescribing the right dose ---> 

<!-- Manipulation of exercise variables may overcome non-responders -->

<!-- Aim loosely defined -->
