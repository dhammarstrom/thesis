\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\lettrine{S}keletal muscle health is essential for physical independence. In a lifespan perspective, measures of muscle mass and/or strength are inversely associated with mortality
(1--6)
and disability
(7).
Besides adverse associations between of low muscle mass and strength and clinical conditions, muscle weakness also accounts for increased health care costs in patient populations
(8,9).
The intercept between muscle mass, muscle function and health status is interrelated with variables such as age and primary illness or injury
(10).
This highlights that interventions designed to increase muscle mass and strength are likely to prevent adverse health outcomes across the lifespan. A higher level of muscle mass and functional capacity would counteract the effects of muscle loss due to illness, age or inactivity.

Although a large degree of the observed variations in lean mass and strength are attributed to genetic components
(11,12),
environmental factors also contribute, leaving a window of opportunity to increase muscle mass and functional capacity. Among factors affecting muscle mass and functioning are nutrition and pharmacological agents. However, physical activity and specifically systematic resistance training of sufficient volume, intensity and frequency provides a stimulus that promote morphological and functional changes to the human neuromuscular system without adverse side-effects. Irrespective of age, resistance training generally leads to increased muscle mass and strength
(13,14)
and is considered safe when performed in a well organized manner
(14,15).

Resistance training can be modulated indefinitely through combined variations of training variables such as frequency, intensity and volume
(16,17).
Well designed training prescriptions should incorporate information about the current state and goals of the trainee to maximize the potential outcome of the training program
(16--18).
Training volume has received particular attention in the scientific community for many reasons. Evidence suggests that exercise volume affects selected molecular determinants of muscle hypertrophy in a dose-dependent manner
(19--21).
Such effects are believed to facilitate long-term training effects as training programs with higher volume generally result in higher gains in muscle mass and strength with little evidence of differences between age groups or participants with different training backgrounds
(22--24). \\
A consequence of a more extensive training program is the increased time required to complete such a program. As time constraints has been reported as a limiting factor for engaging in physical activity
(25)
some merit can be given to arguments against guidlines suggesting higher volume in resistance training prescription
(18,26).
From an individual perspective, training prescription that balances time-requirement with efficacy presumably increases the likelihood of participation in physical activity (25).
From a more general perspective, increased knowledge about mechanisms governing responses to physical training could improve training prescription also for individuals and populations that experience attenuated benefit of resistance training
(27).
The overreaching goal of the present thesis is to contribute to understanding individualized training loads. To this end, training volume was used to study the effects of variable training stimulus in within-participant models of exercise-training.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a large serine-threonine protein kinase wich in complex with oyher regulatory proteins forms a signaling hub responsible for responses to environmental cues such as nutrients and mechanical stress.

mTOR has several phosphorylation sites

Phosphorylation of Ser2448 is mediated by S6K1 to reduce mTOR activity in a negative feedback loop .

Ser2448 is phosphorylated by S6K1, changes in nutrient avaliability modifies S6K1 and Ser2448, Ser2448 phosphorylation is abolished when S6K1 is depleted

When the C-terminal is deleted, mTOR gets constitutively active

\chapter{Aims}\label{aims}}

The primary aim of this thesis was to relate the adaptive response to resistance training with low- and moderate-volume to skeletal-muscle characteristics in previously untrained individuals. The key question was whether manipulation of exercise-volume will have diverse effects in different individuals related to muscular intrinsic characteristics. A further aim was to characterize exercise-volume dependence and time course profiles of molecular mechanism thought to control resistance training-induced muscle growth. Based on these aims, the objectives of the present thesis were;
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  to relate skeletal muscle and systemic characteristics to benefit of moderate- compared to low-volume resistance training;
\item
  To determine volume-dependence in molecular networks related to muscle growth and remodelling in response to mechanical stress
\item
  To determine a time course of markers related to ribosome biogenesis in the early phase of resistance training.

\section{Study participants, protocols and training interventions}\label{study-participants-protocols-and-training-interventions}}

Study I was designed to examine effects of low- and moderate-volume on responses to acute exercise and long-term training within participants. Forty-one healthy individuals were recruited and 34 of these completed at least 85\% of the prescribed sessions and were thus included in subsequent data analyses. Reasons for not completing the trial included injury not related to the study (\emph{n =} 1), pain or discomfort during exercises (\emph{n = }5) and non-adherence to the study protocol. There were no differences in characteristics between participants included in or excluded from data analysis in Study I. Study II was designed to study the effects of resistance training \emph{per se} and effects of variable volume on selected markers related to ribosome biogenesis. Participants were therefore recruited to a training group (\emph{n =} 11) and a non-training control group (\emph{n =} 8). Eligible for participation were young (Study I 18-40; Study II 18-35), non-smoking men and women. Exclusion criteria included a training history of more than one weekly session during the last 12 (Study I) or six (Study II) months leading up to the study. Participants were also screened for intolerance to local anesthetic, current or previous injuries affecting their ability to perform resistance training, self-reported symptoms or history of disease, intake of medication or supplements with known effects on adaptations to training. Participant characteristics for both studies are shown in \ref{tab:characteristics-table}.

Both studies were approved by the local ethics committee Lillehammer University College/Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences and the Norwegian Centre for Research Data. In accordance with the \emph{Declaration of Helsinki}({\textbf{???}}) the studies were pre-registered in publicly accessible databases (Study I, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02179307; Study II, \url{https://osf.io/wa96y}). Participants were informed of the study design, potential risks and sources of discomfort prior to giving their informed consent.

\hypertarget{measures-of-muscle-mass}{%
\section{Measures of muscle mass}\label{measures-of-muscle-mass}}

In Study I muscle mass was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) prior to and after the intervention. Both MRI and DXA measurements were completed during the same visit to the laboratory. Participants were instructed to refrain from strenuous physical activity during the last 48 h leading up to the measurements. The post-training measurements were completed at least 48 h after the last strength testing session. Participants were asked to refrain from food consumption during 2 h leading up to the measurements.

MRI images were obtained from the mid-thigh and analyzed by the same investigator blinded for time (pre- and post-training) and condition (low- and moderate-volume). Multiple images were used to estimate the cross-sectional area of the extensor muscles at the same distance from the knee-joint.

\item
  A normalization factor was used to express relative target gene abundance per-weight tissue.
\item
  In qPCR the linearised expression (effectivety \^{}cq) was used to express the fraction of external reference per total RNA.
\item
  In RNA-seq the external reference gene was sequenced and counts were used to express external RNA as a fraction of total RNA.
\item
  In both cases the normalization factor was calculated as mw * counts.

\textbf{More info}

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.
