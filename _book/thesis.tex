% This is the template used for the GIH thesis. It is based on 
% Reed College LaTeX thesis template. Most of the work (Reed template)
% for the document class was done by Sam Noble (SN), as well as this
% template. Later comments etc. by Ben Salzberg (BTS). Additional
% restructuring and APA support by Jess Youngberg (JY).
%
% See http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex.html for help. There are a
% great bunch of help pages there, with notes on
% getting started, bibtex, etc. Go there and read it if you're not
% already familiar with LaTeX.
%
% Any line that starts with a percent symbol is a comment.
% They won't show up in the document, and are useful for notes
% to yourself and explaining commands.
% Commenting also removes a line from the document;
% very handy for troubleshooting problems. -BTS

% The template was updated by Daniel Hammarström to fit GIH
% requirements. Additional code was borrowed from the 
% Stockholm University (Andreas Solders 2011) template.

% The template was forked from the thesisdown package (CII updates)

\textbf{More info}

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.
