# Introduction

 skeletal muscle functioning is essential in everyday life by enabling movement and thus complex interaction with our environment. Nutrition and pharmacological agents can have substantial effects on skeletal muscle mass and function. However, resistance exercise  of sufficient volume, intensity and frequency is the most potent stimuli to promote morphological and functional changes in the human neuromuscular system. Exercise training can be modulated indefinitely by combining different variations of training variables and in addition, adaptation to exercise training is a phenomenon characterized by great inter-individual variability. The purpose of the present project is therefore to explore potential determinants of variation in adaptability to resistance-exercise modulated by selected exercise-training variables.    

<!-- Why study muscle functioning and health? -->

[@RN2184] <!-- Excess health care costs associated with muscle weakness was estimated to 1.3 billion punds in UK in population above 70 yrs   --> 


<!-- Muscle mass and strength, multiple components contribute to muscle health -->



<!-- Pharmacological/nutritional/exercise interventions to maintain muscle mass --->

<!-- Problem with prescribing the right dose ---> 

<!-- Manipulation of exercise variables may overcome non-responders -->

<!-- Aim loosely defined -->

### The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and translational efficiency
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a large serine-threonine protein kinase wich in complex with oyher regulatory proteins forms a signaling hub responsible for responses to environmental cues such as nutrients and mechanical stress.

mTOR has several phosphorylation sites 

Phosphorylation of Ser2448 is mediated by S6K1 to reduce mTOR activity in a negative feedback loop <!--[@RN1902]-->. 

Ser2448 is phosphorylated by S6K1, changes in nutrient avaliability modifies S6K1 and Ser2448, Ser2448 phosphorylation is abolished when S6K1 is depleted <!--[@RN1902]-->


When the C-terminal is deleted, mTOR gets constitutively active

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can add the `{-}` attribute.

**More info**

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.
