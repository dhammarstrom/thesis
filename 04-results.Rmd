## Effects of different training volume on changes in muscle size and function

Average within participant differences in responses to low- and moderate volume were consistent across measures of muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. Taken together these indicate that MOD was more efficient than LOW in increasing muscle size and strength (Figure \@ref(fig:comb-fig-s1)).
