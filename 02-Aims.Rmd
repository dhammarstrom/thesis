This thesis's primary aim was to relate the adaptive response to resistance training with low- and moderate-volume to skeletal-muscle characteristics in previously untrained individuals. The key question was whether manipulation of exercise-volume will have different effects in different individuals and if this variability was associated with individual characteristics. A further aim was to characterize exercise-volume dependence in molecular muscle characteristics and determine a time course profile of ribosomal biogenesis markers in response to resistance training. <!-- A final aim of the present thesis was to develop an implementation of unbiased reference gene selection to aid gene expression analysis in repeated measures designs   --> Based on these aims, the objectives were;

- to associate skeletal muscle and systemic characteristics to the benefit of moderate- compared to low-volume resistance training.
- To determine volume-dependence in molecular networks related to muscle growth and remodeling in response to resistance training, and,
- to determine a time course of markers related to ribosome biogenesis in the early phase of resistance training.
